example of it working

<b> it will look like its doing <i>nothing</i>, but it is slowly adding keys to the text file.</b>

if you dont know how to import private keys <s>thats not my issue</s> you shouldnt be doing this, <b><i>but</i></b>

1. download electrum (easiest to mass import in my opinion) at https://electrum.org/#home

2. once downloaded, it should prompt you to create a new wallet or something, click next with whatever name you want
